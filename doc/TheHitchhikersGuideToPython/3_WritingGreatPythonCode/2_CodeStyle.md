## Idioms

### Unpacking

Python has a very powerful tuple assignment feature that allows a tuple of variables on the left of an assignment to be assigned values from a tuple on the right of the assignment.

Code like the following, which was taken from [Python for JavaScript Developers](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/python-for-js/#regular-expressions-in-python-and-javascript) is valid:

```python
...
start, end = match.start(), match.end()
```

## [PEP 8](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/#pep-8)

* [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) is the de facto code style guide for Python
* Effective Python (2nd Edition) - Item 2: Should be read with this

### Replace If Statements with Dictionary

[Using a dictionary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z726s8J8HmI) instead of `if`s and `else`s creates a functional, declaritive and polymorphic coding style rather than imperative and procedural.
